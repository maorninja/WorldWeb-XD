/*	Make 18 checks:
	1) If the user can edit his own profile: you don't want to be a hypocrite. This one is checked twice, with one of them being a message, while the other is displaying the page.
	2) If the user can edit other profiles. This is also checked twice, with one of them displaying the page and the other is a message.
	3) If the user has the delete permission set to on. 
	4) If the user has the ban permission set to on: You need to ban the user in order to delete, so it logical that you need that permission on. This is checked twice, one for the message and one to display the delete page. 
	5) If the user is above rank ID -1, it'll block it. It'll only delete the user if the user is below rank ID 0. This one is checked four times, twice being a message and the other two being to display the page. You'll need to ban the user before you delete him.
	6) If the user trying to delete another user is even logged in.
	7) If the user being deleted even exists.
	8) If the user trying to delete is banned and all the nessesary permissions are deactivated (it should normally be deactivated, but who knows) :P: Just because you're banned doesn't mean you have to go nuts and delete users. It'll be a strongly worded message to put some sence into them. Not like the end user will get some sence due to that user getting banned.
	9) If the user trying to delete has a lower rank than the one being deleted. This is checked 4 times, twice being the message, while the other two is displaying the nuke page.

	Yes, I know, its a lot of checks, but you have to be secure. Otherwise, you'll have a destroyed board: The delete feature is very powerfull. If ever someone got a hold of the nuke plugin pre-security updates with the nuke permission, your board can be done for, especially considering that recalc is only allowed to be ran by owner. (And no, I'm not going to make it being ran by permissions, at least, not right now.) I'm not sure how MyBB does it (and I don't want to know; it doesn't interest me.).
